### Description:

Course project for Analysis of Power Systems (EE521). A Julia-based package is being developed to perform Newton-Raphson-based power flow, continuation power flow, power system static state estimation, and basic power system optimization. Currently, power system stability analysis and transient simulation capabilities (EE523) are being implemented.
