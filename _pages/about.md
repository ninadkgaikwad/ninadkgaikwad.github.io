### Bio:

I am Ninad Kiran Gaikwad an ***"Energy Systems Control engineer"*** with a background in Power Systems, Control Systems, and Computer Science. I have previously worked in various research, industry, and academic positions. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the SCALE Lab under Dr. Dubey in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at Washington State University. My current research focuses on intelligent control of networked buildings. My other research interests include employing Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques for optimal control of energy systems. Moreover, I am actively seeking a position in the research/analysis/design of intelligent Power Systems. Looking forward to collaborating with you soon!!!
