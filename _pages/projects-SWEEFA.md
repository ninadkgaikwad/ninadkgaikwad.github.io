### Description:

Master’s Thesis project, in which an entire software for solar and wind energy estimation and forecasting was created in MATLAB using GUI. The software can generate plant-level energy estimation capability for both wind and solar generation plants. The software also has a weather and generation data preprocessing system. Forecasting using ANN and ARIMA can be done using their respective GUI interfaces. Forecasting using WRF (NWP model) is also automated by developing BASH Shell scripts and running them on a cluster of four RaspberryPi-2 micro-computers.
