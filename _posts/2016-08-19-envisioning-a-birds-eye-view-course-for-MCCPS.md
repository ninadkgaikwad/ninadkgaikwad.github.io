### Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of modern engineering and technology, Control of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) stands out as a pivotal field that bridges the gap between the physical systems and their digital representations for an ever intelligent dominoin over the physical systems leading to more efficient engineered systems. CPS involves the integration of computational algorithms based in a rich tradition of applied mathematics with physical processes, enabling the creation of digital twin systems that are more symbiotic, and intelligent as a whole lending to our mastery over our engineered environments. These systems are foundational to critical infrastructures such as power grids, autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and smart cities. As such, the domain of CPS is inherently multi-disciplinary, drawing from system modeling and simulations, applied mathematics, control systems, machine learning, programming among others.

However, the traditional educational pathways often segregate these disciplines into siloed courses, forcing students to piece together knowledge across multiple areas on their own. This approach can lead to fragmented learning experiences, where students struggle to see the connections between concepts that are essential to mastering CPS. The traditional deep-specialization model involving classical courses, while valuable in its own right, is proving increasingly inadequate for students in fields like CPS, where the integration of knowledge across disciplines is not just beneficial but necessary for innovation and problem-solving.

Building on the broader discussion of birds-eye view courses as a solution to the challenges posed by multi-disciplinary research, this response envisions how such a course could be specifically tailored for the domain of Control of Cyber-Physical Systems. By offering a comprehensive, interdisciplinary overview early in a graduate student’s academic journey, a birds-eye view course in CPS could provide the foundational knowledge and integrated perspective needed to navigate this complex field more effectively.

In the following sections, I will explore the multi-disciplinary nature of CPS, identify the current educational gaps, and propose a vision for a birds-eye view course that would equip future researchers with the tools they need to excel in this critical and rapidly evolving domain.

### 1. The Multi-Disciplinary Nature of Control of Cyber-Physical Systems

Control of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a domain that exemplifies the growing necessity for multi-disciplinary research in modern engineering. CPS involves the seamless integration of computational algorithms, grounded in applied mathematics, with physical processes to create digital twin systems that are increasingly symbiotic and intelligent. These systems are not only transforming how we interact with engineered environments but are also foundational to critical infrastructures such as power grids, autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and smart cities.

#### The Essential Disciplines of CPS
To fully grasp and innovate within CPS, students must navigate several key disciplines:

- **System Modeling and Simulation:** This discipline forms the backbone of CPS, allowing engineers to create accurate digital representations (digital twins) of physical systems. These models are crucial for predicting system behavior, testing control strategies, and optimizing performance.

- **Applied Mathematics:** A solid foundation in applied mathematics is essential for developing the algorithms that drive CPS. This includes differential equations, linear algebra, probability, optimization, and estimation, all of which play a critical role in system analysis and control.

- **Control Systems:** Control theory is central to CPS, offering methodologies for designing systems that autonomously regulate their behavior in response to changing conditions. This encompasses classical control methods in both frequency and time domains, nonlinear control for more realistic settings, optimal control approaches like Model Predictive Control (MPC), and advanced data-driven techniques such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML).

- **Machine Learning:** With the increasing complexity of CPS, machine learning techniques are becoming indispensable for tasks such as system identification, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance. Integrating machine learning with control systems is a growing area of research that holds great promise for enhancing system intelligence and autonomy.

- **Programming:** Understanding the how algorithms can be implemented efficiently and with which language using which package and on what hardware is an essential skill that has to be developed for successful prototyping and future seamless deployment in the field.

#### The Complexity of CPS
The multi-disciplinary nature of CPS adds layers of complexity to the field. Researchers must not only be proficient in each of these disciplines but also understand how to integrate them effectively to develop cohesive and efficient systems. For example, designing an autonomous vehicle involves more than just applying control theory; it requires a deep understanding of how to model the vehicle's dynamics, implement machine learning algorithms for perception and decision-making, and ensure that the embedded systems can handle real-time processing demands.

This complexity is compounded by the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of CPS applications. For instance, in a smart grid, the system must continuously adapt to fluctuations in energy supply and demand, integrate renewable energy sources, and ensure reliability and security—all while responding to potential cyber threats.

#### Challenges in Traditional Educational Models
The traditional educational model, with its focus on deep specialization within individual disciplines, is increasingly inadequate for preparing students to tackle the challenges of CPS. Courses in system modeling, control theory, and machine learning are often taught in isolation, without sufficient emphasis on how these areas intersect and interact in practical CPS applications. This compartmentalization can lead to fragmented learning, where students struggle to synthesize the knowledge they need to innovate and solve complex problems in CPS.

Moreover, the rapid pace of technological advancement in CPS means that by the time students have completed their coursework, some of what they have learned may already be outdated. This situation is exacerbated by the lack of integration between disciplines, leaving students to bridge the gaps on their own, often at the expense of their research progress and time to degree completion.

#### The Need for an Integrated Educational Approach
To address these challenges, there is a clear need for an integrated educational approach that aligns with the multi-disciplinary demands of CPS. A birds-eye view course tailored for CPS would provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the field, emphasizing the connections between system modeling, applied mathematics, control theory, machine learning, and embedded systems.

Such a course would not only introduce students to the foundational concepts of each discipline but also demonstrate how these concepts come together to solve real-world problems in CPS. By offering this integrated perspective early in their academic journey, students would be better equipped to navigate the complexities of CPS, make informed decisions about their research focus, and contribute more effectively to the advancement of the field.
